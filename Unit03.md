**Unit 3: Foreign Policy** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to US foreign policy, beginning with the
end of the Cold War. We will look at concepts like “unipolarity,”
“unilateralism,” and “isolationism,” which result when a nation decides
to go it alone, along with the alternatives, “multipolarity,”
“multilateralism,” and “soft balancing,” which result when nations
cooperate and act together with other nations. This overview of US
foreign policy takes place in a period of hegemonic stability: one
nation whose overall power is greater than any other nation. This is a
unique situation, and as a result, the foreign policy positions the US
takes today are unique. If we were to take a look at Russia’s foreign
policy, or China’s foreign policy, their relative positions of power
would cause them to take very different positions from the US.*

     These two articles represent two sides of a debate as to the
    stability of unipolarity. Professor William Wohlforth is a
    well-known scholar arguing that unipolarity is stable while
    Professor Kenneth Waltz, founder of structural realism, argues that
    balancing behavior is bound to arise against the unipole, and it is
    the source of unipolarity’s inherent instability.
