**Unit 8: International Development** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, we will take a look at the topic of international
development and the discrepancies between the developed and developing
world. The unequal distribution of wealth around the globe has led many
impoverished countries to pursue economic development through either
self-dependence or reliance on international aid.  We will look at the
role of NGO’s in that pursuit, as well as theories of growth, including
Structuralism, the Linear-Stages-Growth Model, Neo-Marxism/Dependency
Theory, and the market-based Neo-Classical Theory. We will look at the
role of natural resources, foreign aid, and external debt when it comes
to development. And finally, we will look at the New International
Economic Order and the increasing popularity of Sustainable
Development.*
