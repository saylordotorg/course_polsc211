The purpose of this course is to provide you with a basic understanding
of foreign affairs and introduce you to the fundamental principles of
international relations within the political science framework. We will
examine the theories of realism and liberalism as they are understood in
world politics. These theories will serve as the foundation for more
advanced study in the International Relations field of the Political
Science major, and will help you develop the critical thinking skills
you need in order to analyze conflicts between states. We will also
explore issues that relate to the politics of global welfare, such as
war, world poverty, disease, trade policy, environmental concerns, human
rights, and terrorism. You will learn about the ethics of war, the
global distribution of wealth, the concept of the balance of power and
its relationship to the causes of war, and what happens in the
international system when the balance of power collapses. At the end of
this course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the basic
principles and concepts of International Relations, as well as the
analytical ability to examine the global political system.

important ideas and taking notes. Use the course learning outcomes below
and the learning outcomes below each unit introduction to help you look
for important material. You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. In
order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to work through
all of the course materials.

In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you

**Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you

lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
These should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 10 hours.
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunit 1.1 and half of subunit 1.2 (about 3 hours) on Monday night; the
remainder of subunit 1.2 (about 2 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.3
and half of subunit 1.4 (about 3 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.

each unit introduction, to help you take notes and look for important

rather than specifics. It will be useful to use these notes as a study
guide in preparation for your Final Exam.
