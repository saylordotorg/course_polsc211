**Unit 4: International Conflict** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will take a closer look at war as a means of resolving
conflict. We will examine war from both a Realist’s and a Liberalist’s
perspective, and ask whether conflict between nations is inevitable. We
will also explore complex global welfare issues that require
international cooperation for resolution.*

**Unit 4 Assessment** <span id="4.5"></span> 
-   **Assessment: The Saylor Foundation's “Conflict and Conflict
    Resolution”**
    <span lang="EN">Instructions: Your assessment for Unit 4 is to write
    a paper on “Conflict and Conflict Resolution.” Go through your notes
    from the unit so you will be able to summarize the main concepts in
    a two page written paper.   
      
     When you have finished writing, please compare your paper to the
    Saylor Foundation's
    [“](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/POLSC211-Unit-4-Conflict-and-Conflict-Resolution-FINAL.pdf)</span>[<span
    lang="EN">Conflict and Conflict Resolution: Sample
    Paper</span>](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/POLSC211-Unit-4-Conflict-and-Conflict-Resolution-FINAL.pdf)<span
    lang="EN">[”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/POLSC211-Unit-4-Conflict-and-Conflict-Resolution-FINAL.pdf).
    Be sure your content is similar to the content in the sample paper,
    to be sure you are getting the most important information from the
    material you are covering. Also, read your paper out loud to be sure
    it flows smoothly, and check your paragraphs to be sure that, in
    general, they have opening statements, supporting statements (3),
    and concluding statements. Did you use spell check? You could also
    ask someone else to read your paper, and make comments. And finally,
    be sure any quotes you have used are properly identified and credit
    given. Grading: take one grade off for incomplete content, take one
    grade off for grammatical errors, and take one grade off if it
    doesn't read smoothly (make sense); all 3 errors would make a D
    paper.</span>
