**Unit 2: International Relations Theories** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit examines the theories used to understand international
relations: the two primary theories are realism and liberalism. Realism
argues that the main factor in world politics is power and that the
state constitutes the most important actor in the international system.
Liberalism emphasizes the role of international norms and cooperation in
influencing international relations. This unit will also introduce you
to subcategories of Realist theory, such as Neorealism, the Hegemonic
Stability Theory, and the Balance of Power theory. Next, we will look at
constructivism, which comes from a sociological-legalist view. And
finally, the Marxist theory advocates a class-based and economic
perspective on human progress. These theoretical approaches will afford
you a better understanding of the different ways in which we can analyze
and understand contemporary international politics.*
